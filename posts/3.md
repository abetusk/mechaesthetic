The fonts are extruded and the letters re-positioned to have overlap.

Each of the digits is then glued to the other, with access for the LED strip.

The LED strip is glued to the side and a 3D printed inset diffusor is positioned on

top.

Each digit has a small platform to make sure the inset diffusor is positioned correctly.
