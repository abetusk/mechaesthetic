\[Duke Doks\] creates a [3D printed light marquee](https://youtu.be/3Mkf67_ZnEM).

[![3d light marquee](img/2020-11-10_light-marquee.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Mkf67_ZnEM)

The fonts are extruded and the letters re-positioned to have overlap.

Each of the digits is then glued to the other, with access for the LED strip.

The LED strip is glued to the side and a 3D printed inset diffusor is positioned on

top.

Each digit has a small platform to make sure the inset diffusor is positioned correctly.
