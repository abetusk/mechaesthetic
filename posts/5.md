PCB Stat Tracker
----


###### 2020-10-24

\[25albert\] has created a [table top role playing game (TTRPG) stat tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/j6g78t/cool_pcb_stat_tracker_i_made_for_ttrpgs/).

[![image](img/2020-10-24_pcb-stat-tracker.jpg)](https://imgur.com/a/NghQDxi)

The board uses the PCB as a diffusor for the underlying LEDs.

In addition, the top layer PCB overhang's flex is used

to press the underlying tactile switch, creating a nicer user interface.

\[25alpbert\] gives credit to \[[Nick Poole](https://youtu.be/rAXmzt-_NZ4)\] for the

clever PCB tips and tricks.

\[Behnaz Farahi\] writes:

> This project is inspired by ... masks worn by the Bandari women from southern Iran. ... these masks were developed during Portuguese colonial rule, as a way of protecting ... from the gaze of slave masters looking for pretty women. ... from a contemporary perspective, they can be seen as ... protecting women from patriarchal colonial oppression.

> Here the ‘wink’ of the sexual predator is subverted into a language to protect women from the advances of a predator. ...
