###### 2020-12-01

\[WolfCatWorkshop\] creates a [weight powered automata](https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-of-month-44420893).

The speed is limited by the air friction of the spinning 'fly-fan' with the assembly a combination of

laser cut elements, chains and weights.

PCB Cyberpunk Construction Set
----


###### 2020-11-24

\[Geeek Club\] has a Kickstarter for a [cyberpunk PCB construction set](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geeekclub/geeek-club-cyber-punk-printer-circuit-board-construction-set)

that uses 2d PCB panels soldered together to form artistic cyberpunk themed models.

The models themselves aren't moveable but the circuit boards look to have some functional LEDs.

3D Printed Light Marquee
----


###### 2020-11-10

\[Duke Doks\] creates a [3D printed light marquee](https://youtu.be/3Mkf67_ZnEM).

[![3d light marquee](img/2020-11-10_light-marquee.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Mkf67_ZnEM)

The fonts are extruded and the letters re-positioned to have overlap.

Each of the digits is then glued to the other, with access for the LED strip.

The LED strip is glued to the side and a 3D printed inset diffusor is positioned on

top.

Each digit has a small platform to make sure the inset diffusor is positioned correctly.
