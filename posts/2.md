RGB LED Dice
----

###### 2021-03-21

\[Jean Simonet\] creates [RGB LED "smart" dice](https://www.pixels-dice.com/) called Pixels Dice.

[![pixels on kickstarter](img/2021-03-21-rgb-dice.gif)](https://www.pixels-dice.com/)

The dice look to be [open source hardware](https://hackaday.io/project/28377-pixels),
with firmware for the dice and software to interface with them via Bluetooth available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeansimonet/Pixels).

The dice know their orientation when they land and can light up accordingly.
They can communicate back their position, opening the possibility of novel interfaces,
such as speaking which face they landed on, and allowing custom light patterns
for different rolls.

\[Jean Simonet\] has videos on [the creation process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQzSievR9Zk),
including solder, casting and testing the dice.
