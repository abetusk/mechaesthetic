PCB Cyberpunk Construction Set
----


###### 2020-11-24

\[Geeek Club\] has a Kickstarter for a [cyberpunk PCB construction set](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geeekclub/geeek-club-cyber-punk-printer-circuit-board-construction-set)

that uses 2d PCB panels soldered together to form artistic cyberpunk themed models.

The models themselves aren't moveable but the circuit boards look to have some functional LEDs.
