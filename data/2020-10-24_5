\[25albert\] has created a [table top role playing game (TTRPG) stat tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/j6g78t/cool_pcb_stat_tracker_i_made_for_ttrpgs/).

The board uses the PCB as a diffusor for the underlying LEDs.

In addition, the top layer PCB overhang's flex is used

to press the underlying tactile switch, creating a nicer user interface.

\[25alpbert\] gives credit to \[[Nick Poole](https://youtu.be/rAXmzt-_NZ4)\] for the

clever PCB tips and tricks.
